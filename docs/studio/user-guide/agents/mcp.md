# MCP Server

Studio exposes your team's datasets, storages, knowledge base, and jobs over
[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other MCP clients
connect to it. The agent acts with your Studio permissions and can run DataChain jobs
on the team's clusters. See [Tools](mcp-tools.md) for what it can do.

## Prerequisites

1. **Team settings → AI features → Enable AI** is on. No LLM provider is needed.
   Knowledge search and the knowledge index require generated pages; the enrichment
   tools generate them using the team's provider and budget. See
   [Knowledge Base](knowledge-base.md).
2. Copy the MCP URL from **Team settings → AI features → MCP server**. It looks like
   `https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>`.

## Install the skill

```bash
pip install datachain
datachain skill install --target claude   # also: --target cursor, --target codex
```

The skill is the instructions, MCP is the tools. The skill tells the agent to check the
knowledge base before computing anything, how to name and save datasets, and which SDK
rules a script must follow; MCP is how it acts on the team's data in Studio.

## Connect

=== "Claude Code"

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport http --scope user studio https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>
    ```

    Start Claude Code, run `/mcp`, select **studio**, choose **Authenticate**, and
    approve access in the browser. To share the setup through a repository, commit
    `.mcp.json` at its root; it holds no credentials.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "studio": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Claude Desktop and claude.ai"

    1. **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**.
    2. Name: `Studio`. URL: the MCP URL. Leave the advanced fields empty.
    3. Click **Add**, then **Connect**, and approve access in the browser.
    4. In a chat, open the tools menu (the **+** button) and make sure **Studio** is
       enabled.

    On Team and Enterprise plans an organization owner adds the connector once; each
    member then connects it. Custom connectors require a paid plan.

=== "Codex"

    ```bash
    codex mcp add studio --url https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>
    codex mcp login studio
    ```

    Approve access in the browser. Codex CLI, the Codex IDE extension, and the ChatGPT
    desktop app share this configuration.

=== "Cursor"

    Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (all projects) or `.cursor/mcp.json` in a repository:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "studio": {
          "url": "https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Open **Settings → MCP** and click **Needs login** next to **studio**.

=== "VS Code"

    1. Open the Command Palette and run **MCP: Add Server**.
    2. Select **HTTP**, enter the MCP URL and the name `studio`, and choose **Global** or
       **Workspace**.
    3. Run **MCP: List Servers**, select **studio**, click **Start Server**, and approve
       access in the browser.

=== "Other"

    Follow your client's instructions for a remote server and use the MCP URL. The server
    speaks Streamable HTTP and supports OAuth with dynamic client registration; request
    the scopes `DATASETS JOBS`. If the client cannot sign in through a browser, use an
    [access token](#access-tokens).

Then ask the agent:

```prompt
What datasets does my team have in Studio?
```

A connected client calls the `list_datasets` tool and answers with dataset names from
Studio. If no tool call appears in the transcript, the client did not use the server.

## Authentication

Interactive clients sign in with OAuth: the client opens the Studio sign-in page, you
approve once, and the client keeps the session.

### Access tokens

For CI, scripts, or agents without a browser, create a token under **Personal settings
→ Tokens** with an expiration and only the scopes and role the agent's tools need, per
the [tools table](mcp-tools.md): **DATASETS** with the Read role to browse, the Write
role to enrich, **JOBS** with the Write role to run jobs; Admin only for team-wide
enrichment. Keep the token in an environment variable and reference it from the config.

=== "Claude Code"

    `.mcp.json` at the project root; `${STUDIO_TOKEN}` is expanded from the environment.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "studio": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>",
          "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${STUDIO_TOKEN}" }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Codex"

    ```bash
    export STUDIO_TOKEN=<token>
    codex mcp add studio --url https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team> --bearer-token-env-var STUDIO_TOKEN
    ```

=== "Cursor"

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "studio": {
          "url": "https://studio.datachain.ai/api/mcp/<team>",
          "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:STUDIO_TOKEN}" }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Permissions and safety

- The agent sees what your Studio account can see on that team, further limited by the
  token's scopes. See [Security & Permissions](../teams/permissions.md).
- `run_job` executes code on the team's compute cluster. Keep your client's per-call
  confirmation on for `run_job`, `cancel_job`, and `enrich_all`.
- To revoke access, delete the token under **Personal settings → Tokens**. Turning off
  **Enable AI** disconnects every client of the team.

## Troubleshooting

- **401, or the client keeps asking to authenticate**: sign in again from the client.
- **403 "No access to team"**: your account is not a member of the team in the URL, or
  the token was created for another team.
- **403 "AI features are disabled for this team"**: turn on **Enable AI**.
