# job ls

List jobs in Studio.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: datachain job ls [-h] [-v] [-q] [--status STATUS] [--team TEAM] [--limit LIMIT] [--json] [-e]
```

## Description

This command lists jobs in Studio. You can filter jobs by their status, specify a team, and limit the number of jobs returned. By default, it shows the 20 most recent jobs.

Every job shows its ID, name, status, creation time and author. `--extended` adds the compute cluster it ran on and a breakdown of its stages - see [Extended output](#extended-output).


## Options

* `--status STATUS` - Status to filter jobs by
* `--team TEAM` - Team to list jobs for (default: from config)
* `--limit LIMIT` - Limit the number of jobs returned (default: 20)
* `--json` - Print the job list as JSON
* `-e`, `--extended` - Show [extra job details](#extended-output)
* `-h`, `--help` - Show the help message and exit
* `-v`, `--verbose` - Be verbose
* `-q`, `--quiet` - Be quiet

## Extended output

`--extended` adds two columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Cluster` | The compute cluster the job ran on. [`datachain job clusters`](clusters.md) shows what that cluster is - its region, machine and capacity |
| `Stages` | How long the job spent in each stage |

```

|                                      |        |          |                      |              |              | Running query: 12m 26s          |
+--------------------------------------+--------+----------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------------------------+
```

A job passes through some of: waiting in queue, requesting workers, preparation, installing dependencies, downloading files, waking up the data warehouse, and running the query. A stage still going reads `running`, and one whose timing is unavailable reads `-` - never `0s`.

Comparing time queued against time running the query is how you tell a slow job from one that sat waiting for a worker.

## JSON output

`--json` returns the full job details as JSON. Add `--extended` for stage timestamps; `--status`, `--limit` and `--team` still apply.

```bash
datachain job ls --json --extended --status failed
```

Match a job to a cluster on `compute_cluster_id`, not on the cluster's name. A retired cluster keeps its jobs but no longer appears in [`datachain job clusters`](clusters.md), and a later cluster can take its name, so matching on the name can attribute a job to a machine it never ran on.

## Status options

You will be able to filter the job with following status:

* `CREATED` - Job has been created but not yet scheduled
* `SCHEDULED` - Job is scheduled to run at a future time
* `QUEUED` - Job is in the queue waiting to be executed
* `INIT` - Job is initializing and preparing to run
* `RUNNING` - Job is currently executing
* `COMPLETE` - Job has finished successfully
* `FAILED` - Job has failed during execution
* `CANCELING_SCHEDULED` - A scheduled job is being canceled
* `CANCELING` - A running job is being canceled
* `CANCELED` - Job has been canceled
* `ACTIVE` - Job is in active state.
* `INACTIVE` - Job is in inactive state.

Note: The following statuses are considered active jobs:

* `CREATED`
* `SCHEDULED`
* `QUEUED`
* `INIT`
* `RUNNING`
* `CANCELING_SCHEDULED`
* `CANCELING`


## Examples

1. List all jobs (default limit of 20):
```bash
datachain job ls
```

2. List jobs for a specific team:
```bash
datachain job ls --team my-team
```

3. List jobs with a specific status:
```bash
datachain job ls --status complete
```

4. List more jobs by increasing the limit:
```bash
datachain job ls --limit 50
```

5. List jobs with verbose output:
```bash
datachain job ls -v
```

6. List jobs with extra details, including the compute cluster they ran on:
```bash
datachain job ls --extended
```

## Notes

* The default limit of 20 jobs helps manage the output size and performance
* Jobs are typically listed in reverse chronological order (newest first)
* Use the `--status` filter to find jobs in specific states (e.g., running, completed, failed)
* `--extended` asks for more, so plain `job ls` stays the quicker way to check what is running
* [`datachain job logs`](logs.md) shows a job's output
