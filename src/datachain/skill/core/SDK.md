# DataChain SDK Rules

Apply every rule below when generating DataChain Python code.

## Pre-Generation Checklist

- [ ] **Every UDF has a known output type.** Functions passed to `.map()`, `.gen()`, or `.agg()` must have their return type resolved. See §2 Rule 2 — the #1 runtime error.
- [ ] **No `from __future__ import annotations` in UDF modules.** It stringifies type hints; DataChain's signal-schema resolution then rejects the string-vs-class mismatch.
- [ ] **Heavy-init resources load via `.setup()`**, not module-level lazy globals:
  ```python
  chain.setup(model=lambda: load_model()).map(result=run_model)
  ```
  Lazy globals leak across `parallel=N` workers and hide the dependency from the chain definition. See §2 Rule 20.
- [ ] **`.settings(parallel=N)` is the right tool only when the workload benefits.** See §2 Rule 6.

## Section 1 — Dataset Reuse (Highest Priority)

**Before writing any pipeline code, check what already exists.**

**Reuse over rebuild.** Start from an existing dataset (`dc.read_dataset("name")`) whenever it covers the data the user needs — even partially. Filter, merge, or extend it instead of re-reading raw storage.

Only go to raw storage when no existing dataset covers the needed data, or the user explicitly asks to start fresh.

### Dataset-first reasoning

Datasets are the unit of reasoning. Chains that transform data through UDFs — or that produce a pipeline's final result — should be saved as named datasets.

**Core rule: always `.save()`, never just `.show()`.** A pipeline's terminal operation is `.save("descriptive_name")`, followed by `.show()` on the saved result for display. Two exceptions: (1) one-off exploratory queries where the user explicitly asks to "show me" or "print"; (2) a cheap final query whose result is a one-time answer. A chain that ran an expensive UDF is always saved.

**Critical anti-pattern: bypassing `.save()` by dumping in-memory rows to a file.** Reading the chain via `.to_list()` / `.to_values()` and writing to disk via `open()`, `json.dump`, `pandas.to_csv`, or any Python-side file handle is forbidden for UDF-bearing pipelines. The pipeline result must land as a saved dataset first via `.save()`. Once saved, exporting via `chain.to_csv()`, `chain.to_parquet()`, `chain.to_storage()` is fine.

**Not a bypass:** a UDF that materializes a payload to storage and returns a `dc.File` pointer. The dataset still lands via `.save()`; the file in storage is the row's payload, owned by DataChain via the pointer.

```python
# ✗ ANTI-PATTERN — UDF result pulled into Python and dumped to disk.
results = chain.map(emb=encode_image).to_list("file", "emb")
with open("similar_results.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f)

# ✓ Save the dataset first, then export from it if needed.
saved = chain.map(emb=encode_image).save("product_catalog_embeddings")
saved.to_csv("similar_results.csv")
```

**What to save — the UDF rule:**

- **Any chain that runs a UDF (`.map()`, `.gen()`, `.agg()`)** must be saved with `.save("name")`. UDFs embody domain logic and produce structured output worth preserving.
- **Final pipeline results.** Rankings, filtered cohorts, evaluation outputs, aggregations — always `.save("name")`.
- **Chains with no UDFs** (`read_storage` + `filter`/`mutate`/`select` only) may remain transient — cheap to recompute, easy to read from the code.

**Prompt-trigger keywords for `.save()`.** When the user's task description contains "make available for downstream queries", "compute per-X aggregates", "build / extract / produce X", "store / persist / materialize / save", "process and save" — call `.save("name")` and print a short summary (name + row count or a few stats), not the full result set.

**`.persist()` is not `.save()`.** `.persist()` materializes a chain into an anonymous dataset — it prevents re-execution but creates no named dataset. When a chain should be saved per the rules above, use `.save("name")`.

### Code-level decomposition: one stage = one script

A multi-stage pipeline that produces multiple named datasets through expensive stages (LLM calls, embeddings, ML inference) belongs in MULTIPLE scripts — one per stage — not folded into one monolith. Each script reads from the previous stage's saved dataset via `dc.read_dataset(...)` and writes its own with `.save("name")`.

**Split when ANY** of these hold for the stage output: runs an LLM/VLM/embedding/inference call; will be reused by future questions; will exceed ~10 rows and the user might inspect or merge later; wall time >5 min; chain has 3+ distinct operations.

**Don't split** for: single filter/select/limit on an existing dataset; cheap metadata aggregation; a one-off query that displays rather than saves.

**Naming:** each script is named after the dataset it produces.

```
build_product_catalog_embeddings.py    →  product_catalog_emb dataset
build_product_catalog_metadata.py      →  product_catalog_meta dataset
similar_to_query.py                     →  products_similar_to_query (or ad-hoc)
```

Generate stage scripts up front, on the first pass — "I'll write one script for speed and refactor later" is the regression.

### Expensive compute: save full, filter downstream

When a UDF is expensive (ML inference, LLM calls), save the **full, unfiltered** result before any filtering. A downstream `.save()` after filtering only preserves a fraction of the rows; the rest of the compute is lost.

**Problem-specific filters belong DOWNSTREAM of the expensive `.save()`.** A filter is **problem-specific** if its criterion comes from the user's task description (a named exclusion, a threshold, a category) — it MUST go after the expensive `.save()`. A filter is **data-quality** if it would apply to ANY question over this dataset (corrupted file, mandatory field missing) — it MAY go before.

```python
# ✗ Pre-filtering with problem-specific criteria — embeddings useless for next question.
embeddings = (
    dc.read_storage("s3://product-catalog/images/")
    .filter(dc.C("condition") != "refurbished")  # ← problem-specific
    .filter(dc.C("width") > 400)  # ← problem-specific
    .setup(model=lambda: clip)
    .map(emb=encode_image)
    .save("product_catalog_clip")  # ← USELESS for next question
)

# ✓ Save embeddings over the WHOLE input, filter downstream.
embeddings = (
    dc.read_storage("s3://product-catalog/images/")
    .setup(model=lambda: clip)
    .map(emb=encode_image)
    .save(
        "product_catalog_clip",
        description="CLIP ViT-B-32 embeddings over the full product-catalog bucket.",
    )
)

ranked = (
    dc.read_dataset("product_catalog_clip")
    .merge(dc.read_dataset("product_catalog_meta"), on="file.stem")
    .filter(dc.C("condition") != "refurbished")  # ← problem-specific, downstream
    .filter(dc.C("width") > 400)
    .mutate(distance=dc.func.cosine_distance(dc.C("emb"), query_emb))
    .order_by("distance")
    .limit(5)
    .save(
        "products_similar_to_query",
        description="Top-5 catalog products visually closest to query.jpg under the filter set.",
    )
)
```

**Data-quality filters before the UDF are fine:**

```python
embeddings = (
    dc.read_storage("s3://b/")
    .filter(dc.C("file.size") > 0)  # ← data-quality, OK
    .setup(model=lambda: clip)
    .map(emb=encode_image)
    .save("clip_embeddings")
)
```

### Row shape — grain and provenance

**Grain: one row per unit the operation emits.** Object detection emits one detection per box → one row per detection; segmentation → one row per segment; LLM extraction → one row per response; header parsing → one row per file. At the operation's own grain every downstream question is one `.filter()` / `.group_by()`. At a coarser grain the answer sits inside `list[list[T]]` at the root, and every query needs a `.gen()` to fan it out first.

Aggregating up from a fine grain costs one `.group_by()`; fanning down from a coarse one costs a `.gen()` per query, forever. The trap is matching the row to the first noun in the question ("find VIDEOS with people" → one row per video) and discovering at query time that the filter target (`label == "person"`) is nested two lists deep.

```python
# ✗ per-video rows — no filter reaches `label`.
class VideoDetections(BaseModel):
    frames: list[FrameDetections]  # each holds detections: list[Detection]


# ✓ per-detection rows — every question is one filter / group_by.
class Detection(BaseModel):
    source: dc.VideoFile  # row provenance
    frame_idx: int
    timestamp: float
    label: str
    confidence: float
    bbox: list[float]
```

A coarser grain is right when the operation itself emits one unit per file (one classification per video, one embedding per document), or when the user asks for it.

**Provenance: every emitted row carries its source file, typed.** A UDF that fans one file out into many rows puts the originating file on each emitted row as `dc.File` or a subclass (`dc.VideoFile`, `dc.ImageFile`, `dc.AudioFile`, `dc.TextFile`) — never `source: str`. A bare path loses etag-based change detection and the link back to the listing, loses Studio previews, loses `.read()` / `.open()` / `.get_info()` on the row, and loses the access config (`anon=True`, credentials) that travels with a typed file. Do not rely on parent-column propagation to carry it implicitly — the saved schema is the contract the next session reads.

```python
def detect_per_frame(file: dc.VideoFile, model) -> Iterator[Detection]:
    for frame in file.get_frames(step=...):
        for box in model(frame.get_np()).boxes:
            yield Detection(source=file, frame_idx=..., ...)  # pass the source through
```

When the user needs a plain string path, keep the typed file and add the string as a second column.

### Naming and description

Names describe content: `product_catalog_clip`, `cik_text_stats`. Keep them under ~30 characters — longer names are truncated in dataset lists and table headers. Parameters (model id, preset, threshold) belong in the code, never in the name.

Every `.save()` sets `description=` — one line on what the dataset holds and what it is good for. That line is what the next reader sees in `dc.datasets()` and in the knowledge-base index.

```python
chain.save(
    "product_catalog_clip",
    description="CLIP ViT-B-32 embeddings over the full product-catalog bucket.",
)
```

Lineage is tracked automatically when a chain reads one dataset and saves another — never encode a parent name by hand.

## Section 2 — Critical Rules

```
0. TRAILING SLASH: Always add / to bucket/prefix paths.
   ✓ dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/images/")
   ✗ dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/images")  ← permission error on anon access

1. ANON FOR PUBLIC BUCKETS (auto-detected): When `anon` is not passed,
    `dc.read_storage()` probes the bucket anonymously first; if the probe
    succeeds, it transparently sets `anon=True`. No need to pass `anon=True`
    for public buckets — works whether or not cloud credentials are configured.
    Pass `anon=True` explicitly only to skip the probe round-trip in a
    latency-sensitive path. Pass `anon=False` to bypass the anonymous probe
    for private buckets.
    Applies ONLY to dc.read_storage() — NOT to File.at() or other APIs.
    ✓ dc.read_storage("gs://bucket/data/")                # auto-detected
    ✓ dc.read_storage("gs://bucket/data/", anon=True)     # explicit, skips probe
    ✗ dc.File.at("gs://bucket/file.txt", anon=True)        ← File.at() has no anon param

    **Anon does NOT propagate across `.save()` boundaries.** A downstream UDF
    that calls `file.open()` in a new process makes a fresh HeadObject without
    anon → 403. Fix: pass anon into the downstream session via `client_config`:
    ✓ session = dc.Session.get(client_config={"anon": True})
      (dc.read_dataset("my_bucket_files", session=session)
         .map(emb=encode_image)
         .save("my_bucket_emb"))

2. EVERY UDF MUST HAVE A KNOWN OUTPUT TYPE. A UDF passed to map/gen/agg without
   a resolved return type defaults to str and crashes at runtime for any non-str
   value. This is the #1 source of production errors — enforce strictly.

   Three ways to specify the output type, in priority order:

   (a) Named function with return type annotation — PREFERRED, use by default.
       ✓ def get_info(file: dc.ImageFile) -> dc.Image:
             return file.get_info()
         chain.map(info=get_info)
       ✓ def get_name(path: str) -> str:
             return path.split("/")[-1]
         chain.map(name=get_name, params=["file.path"])

   (b) Lambda — ONLY when return type is str (the default). If the return type
       is anything other than str, you MUST pair the lambda with output=.
       ✓ chain.map(name=lambda path: path.split("/")[-1], params=["file.path"])
       ✓ chain.map(sz=lambda size: size // 1024, params=["file.size"], output={"sz": int})
       ✗ chain.map(info=lambda file: file.get_info())  # no output= → crash; also downloads file
       ✗ chain.map(size=lambda file: file.size)         # no output= → crash; also downloads file

   (c) output= parameter — LAST RESORT for named functions, only when you cannot
       annotate the function (e.g., third-party callable you cannot modify).
       ✓ chain.map(emb=third_party_fn, output={"emb": list[float]})

   params= is allowed with any of the above to bind function parameters to specific
   columns (e.g., nested fields like "file.path"). Prefer matching function parameter
   names to column names when possible.

   `.gen()` needs an explicit `-> Iterator[T]` — not a bare return, not `Iterator`,
   not `Iterator[Any]`; a missing annotation collapses the saved schema to str over
   every row. `T` is a primitive or a Pydantic model declared at module level, never
   nested inside the function or imported lazily.

3. AVOID FILE OBJECT WHEN CONTENT NOT NEEDED: Passing a File object to a UDF
    downloads the full content, even if the UDF only reads metadata. This applies
    to File and ALL its subclasses.
    - Use params= to bind UDF args to nested columns like "file.path", "file.size".
    - For pure SQL path ops: use mutate() with func.path.* (no Python needed).
    - Pass File object ONLY when you need file content (.read(), .open(), etc.).
    ✓ chain.map(category=classify, params=["file.path"])     # no download
    ✓ chain.mutate(stem=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")))   # pure SQL
    ✗ chain.map(category=lambda file: file.path.split("/")[-2])  # downloads entire file

4. COLUMN NAMING: keyword in map/gen/agg = new column name.
   chain.map(embedding=fn)  → column is named "embedding"

5. INPUT PARAM: The file column is always named "file" regardless of modality.
   Use params= when arg names don't match column names:
   chain.map(label=process, params=["file.path"])

6. PARALLEL WHEN NEEDED: Only use .settings(parallel=N) when the workload benefits.
   Use when per-row work is I/O-bound (file download, API calls), or CPU-bound
   AND the UDF doesn't already saturate cores via internal threading.
   Skip when the model saturates the device (single-GPU), the total wall is <30s
   (bootstrap dominates), or per-worker memory × N would OOM.
   Rough picks: I/O-bound → parallel=4-8; CPU-bound → parallel=2-4; external API → parallel=8-16.
   ✓ chain.settings(parallel=4).map(emb=model_fn)
   ✓ chain.map(label=classify)                       # lightweight → sequential
   `workers=N` is Studio-only distributed processing — guard with dc.is_studio():
   ✓ chain = chain.settings(parallel=4)
     if dc.is_studio():
         chain = chain.settings(workers=8)

7. PREFETCH FOR FILE-READING UDFs: Estimate avg file size and compute:
     prefetch = clamp(4MB / estimated_avg_size, 2, 128)
   Only add .settings(prefetch=N) if N > 4 (default is 2). Skip for UDFs that
   don't read file content. Skip if the user explicitly sets prefetch.

8. CACHE ONLY WHEN NEEDED: Do not add cache=True by default. Use only when the
   same files are read multiple times (multi-stage pipelines), or the user asks.

9. COLUMN-COLUMN ARITHMETIC: Use chain.column() instead of C() when combining
   two columns. C() does not carry type info → transpiler can't infer the result.
   ✓ chain.mutate(total=chain.column("price") * chain.column("qty"))
   ✓ chain.mutate(discounted=C("price") * 0.9)          # scalar → C() is fine
   ✗ chain.mutate(total=C("price") * C("qty"))           # no type → error

10. READ NOT FROM: Use dc.read_* module functions. `DataChain.from_*` methods
    were removed; they raise AttributeError.
    ✓ dc.read_csv("s3://data.csv")
    ✓ dc.read_dataset("name")
    ✗ DataChain.from_csv("s3://data.csv")        ← AttributeError
    `from datachain import DataChain` is itself a smell — never write it.
    Never assign to the name `dc`: `dc = DataChain.from_dataset("x")` shadows
    the package and breaks every subsequent `dc.read_*`, `dc.C`, `dc.func.*`.

11. GLOB IN PATH: When filtering by extension or name pattern, put the glob
    directly in the read_storage() path instead of a separate .filter() call.
    The type= parameter only sets the File subclass — it does NOT filter the listing.
    ✓ dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}", type="image")
    ✗ dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/", type="image")  ← lists ALL files

12. SINGLE FILE vs MULTI FILE: Use the right API.
    - One known file: dc.File.at() / dc.TextFile.at() / dc.ImageFile.at()
    - One known CSV/JSON/Parquet: dc.read_csv() / dc.read_json() / dc.read_parquet()
    - A small fixed set: one read_storage() with a glob pattern.
    - Many files in a directory: dc.read_storage()
    read_storage() is for directory listing — don't use it for a single known file.

13. ONE SIGNAL PER MAP/GEN/AGG: Each call accepts exactly one signal.
   For multiple columns, chain calls or return a Pydantic BaseModel.
   ✗ chain.map(a=fn1, b=fn2)              # ERROR: multiple signals

14. NO TUPLE RETURNS, NO DICT RETURNS: Always prefer Pydantic BaseModel classes to tuple
    or dict in map/gen/agg functions until user directly asks for tuple.
    ✓ def fn(file: dc.File) -> MyModel: ...   # named fields via BaseModel
    ✓ def fn(file: dc.File) -> int: ...       # single scalar
    ✗ def fn(file: dc.File) -> tuple[int, int]: ...  # → col_0, col_1
    ✗ def fn(file: dc.File) -> dict: ...      # dict keys become VALUES, not names → crash

    **Multi-column output: use BaseModel, NEVER tuple-via-output{}.** Pairing a
    tuple-returning UDF with `output={"width": int, "height": int}` works by
    positional accident; BaseModel is the canonical, named, addressable form:
    ✓ class Dims(BaseModel):
          width: int
          height: int
      def get_dims(file: dc.ImageFile) -> Dims:
          info = file.get_info()
          return Dims(width=info.width, height=info.height)
      chain.map(dims=get_dims)                                     # → dims.width, dims.height
    ✗ def get_dims(file: dc.ImageFile) -> tuple[int, int]: ...
      chain.map(dims=get_dims, output={"width": int, "height": int})  # ← anti-pattern

    **Scope.** This rule covers UDFs passed to `.map()`, `.gen()`, `.agg()` — their
    return values become chain signals (columns). Tuple returns force auto-generated
    names (`col_0`, `col_1`) that downstream `.merge()` / `.select_except()` can't
    address. The rule does NOT apply to:
      - Free helper functions called inside UDFs (return any Python shape).
      - `.setup(name=loader_fn)` loaders. The loader's return value is an opaque
        per-worker resource, not a chain signal. A tuple works; BaseModel is nicer
        when the loader produces multiple distinct resources.

15. MERGE NOT DICTS: When combining sources, read each as its own chain, parse
    inside map()/gen(), then merge(). Never build Python dicts outside the chain
    and close over them in map()/gen().
    ✓ annotations = dc.read_storage("./**/list.txt", type="text").gen(ann=parse_list)
      images = dc.read_storage("./images/", type="image")
      images.merge(annotations, on=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")), right_on="ann.name")

16. SHARED LISTING PREFIX: When multiple read_storage() target the same tree,
    use the common parent prefix and glob from there. DataChain caches listings
    by prefix — shared prefix = one listing + cache hits.

17. LAZY CHAINS — NO DOUBLE EXECUTION: Chains are lazy — each terminal op
    re-executes the pipeline. Never call two terminal ops on the same chain.
    - After save(): use the returned chain (save() returns the saved dataset).
    - For multi-use chains: call .persist() to materialize once.
    ✓ saved = chain.save("my_data"); saved.show(5)
    ✓ materialized = chain.persist(); materialized.show(5); materialized.to_csv("out.csv")
    ✗ chain.save("my_data"); chain.show(5)               ← runs the pipeline twice

18. INLINE FUNC EXPRESSIONS: Pass func/C expressions directly to on=, right_on=,
    partition_by=, order_by=. Don't mutate() a throwaway column.
    For UDFs that need nested fields, use params= instead of mutate().
    ✓ chain.merge(other, on=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")), ...)
    ✓ chain.map(label=classify, params=["file.path"])
    ✗ chain.mutate(stem=...).merge(other, on="stem")  ← unnecessary column

19. SELECT_EXCEPT AFTER MERGE: After merge(), use select_except() to drop duped
    columns. Never write a long select() list (>4 columns). When chaining multiple
    merges, do ALL merges first, then ONE select_except() at the end.

20. INLINE SETUP OVER UDF CLASS: Prefer chain.setup() over dc.Mapper/Generator
    classes. A plain function + .setup() achieves model/client initialization
    without introducing a class. Use dc.Mapper only when setup requires multiple
    self.* fields or custom __init__ args.

21. MATERIALIZE BEFORE MULTI-MERGE AND AFTER GROUP_BY: When merging 2+ right-side
    chains that contain UDFs, materialize each before the merge. Without it, the
    final terminal op may re-execute UDF pipelines multiple times during merge.
    Use .save("name") when the chain warrants a named dataset (has a UDF with reuse
    value). Use .persist() only when not warranting a name (group_by intermediates).
    Skip materialization when the right side has no UDFs (pure metadata/filter).
    Also persist() after group_by() when the result feeds further operations.
    ✓ a = chain_a.map(x=fn1).save("feature_a")
      b = chain_b.gen(y=fn2).save("feature_b")
      images.merge(a, ...).merge(b, ...).save("out")
    ✓ counts = chain.group_by(n=func.count(), partition_by="cat").persist()
      counts.filter(C("n") > 5).save("popular")
    ✗ a = chain_a.map(x=fn1)       # lazy → UDFs re-execute during merge
      b = chain_b.gen(y=fn2)
      images.merge(a, ...).merge(b, ...).save("out")
```

---

## Section 3 — Golden Rule

1. **Always use DataChain for data file access.** NEVER use stdlib (`os.walk`, `os.listdir`, `glob.glob`, `pathlib.Path.iterdir()`, `.glob()`, `.rglob()`) to discover or traverse DATA files. They lose lineage, skip prefetch/cache, and can't be materialized as a typed dataset.
   - Single known file: `dc.File.at()` / `dc.TextFile.at()` / `dc.ImageFile.at()`
   - Single CSV/JSON/Parquet: `dc.read_csv()` / `dc.read_json()` / `dc.read_parquet()`
   - Many files: `dc.read_storage()` (vectorised, preserves lineage)
   - Glob: use `dc.read_storage("path/**/*.ext")`, NOT `glob.glob`

   **Scope.** This rule governs DATA file access. Reading a handful of log/metadata files for one-off introspection during debugging is outside the rule.

2. **Prefer Data Memory over Compute Engine.** Data Memory ops — `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `order_by()`, `select()`, `merge()`, `union()`, `distinct()`, `limit()` — run as SQL at warehouse speed using `dc.C()` and `dc.func.*`. Compute Engine ops (`map`/`gen`/`agg`) run heavy Python in parallel workers and are expensive. Use Compute Engine ONLY for file content reads, model inference, LLM calls, external APIs.

3. **Extracting results.** Use `to_values()` for one column (returns flat list); `to_list()` for multiple columns (returns tuples). Never use `to_iter()` — it loses parallelism and lineage. For processing, use `map()` / `gen()` rather than extracting and looping.
   ```python
   files = chain.to_values("file")  # → [File(...), ...]
   rows = chain.to_list("file", "label")  # → [(File, "cat"), ...]
   ```

## Section 4 — Import Cheat Sheet

- ✓ `import datachain as dc` — the ONLY way to import the package.
- ✓ `from pydantic import BaseModel` — for custom schemas.
- ✓ `from datachain import model` — for annotation type imports (rare).
- ✗ `from datachain import File, C, func, ...` — NEVER. Use `dc.File`, `dc.C`, `dc.func`.
- ✗ `from datachain import DataChain` — NEVER. Use `dc.read_*` module functions.
- ✗ `dc = DataChain.from_dataset("x")` — NEVER assign to `dc`. It shadows the package.

```python
import datachain as dc
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

## Section 5 — Core API Reference

**Entry points.** `read_storage()` creates a cached listing keyed by prefix; subsequent calls with the same prefix reuse the cache.

```python
dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/prefix/", type="image")  # File / ImageFile etc.
dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/imgs/**/*.{jpg,png}", type="image")  # glob in path
dc.read_csv("s3://bucket/data.csv")
dc.read_json("s3://bucket/ann.json", jmespath="images")
dc.read_parquet("s3://bucket/data/*.parquet")
dc.read_hf("dataset-name", split="train")
dc.read_pandas(df)
dc.read_values(scores=[1.2, 3.4])
dc.read_records([{"a": 1}, ...])
dc.read_database("SELECT * FROM t", "sqlite:///local.db")
dc.read_dataset("name")  # latest version
dc.read_dataset("name", version="2.0.0")
```

**Data Memory (SQL, fast).** `C` = `dc.C`, `func` = `dc.func`.

```python
chain.filter(C("file.size") > 1000)
chain.filter((C("det.label") == "cat") & (C("det.conf") > 0.9))
chain.filter(C("file.path").glob("*.jpg"))
chain.filter(
    C("name").contains("alice")
)  # also startswith, endswith, like, ilike, regexp
chain.filter(C("name").isnot(None))  # also is_(None)
chain.filter(C("price").between(10, 25))
chain.filter(C("name").in_(["alice", "bob"]))
# Combinators — always parenthesize: & (and), | (or), ~ (not)
chain.mutate(ext=func.path.file_ext(C("file.path")))
chain.mutate(dist=func.cosine_distance(C("emb"), reference))
chain.mutate(total=chain.column("price") * chain.column("qty"))  # column-column
chain.mutate(discounted=C("price") * 0.9)  # scalar → C() is fine
chain.mutate(
    price_int=chain.column("price").cast(sa.Integer)
)  # import sqlalchemy as sa
chain.group_by(
    cnt=func.count(), total=func.sum(C("file.size")), partition_by="category"
)
chain.order_by("dist")
chain.order_by("score", descending=True)
chain.distinct("response.text")
chain.distinct(file_ext=func.path.file_ext(C("file.path")))  # expressions need names
chain.limit(100)
chain.select("file", "score")
chain.select("file", score_pct=C("score") * 100)
chain.select_except("internal_id")
chain.merge(other, on="id", right_on="meta.id")  # left join (default)
chain.merge(other, on="id", inner=True)  # inner
chain.merge(other, on="id", full=True)  # full outer
chain.union(other)
chain.subtract(other)
chain.diff(other, on="id", compare=["score"])
chain.file_diff(other)
```

`merge()` has NO `how=` parameter. Use `inner=True` or `full=True`.

**Compute Engine (Python workers, expensive):**

```python
chain.map(col_name=fn)  # 1 input → 1 output record
chain.gen(col_name=fn)  # 1 input → N output records
chain.agg(col_name=fn, partition_by="key")
```

**Setup and settings:**

```python
chain.setup(model=lambda: load_model()).map(fn)
chain.settings(parallel=4, cache=True, prefetch=10)
if dc.is_studio():
    chain = chain.settings(workers=50)
```

**Terminal operations.** `.save()` creates a named, versioned, KB-tracked dataset. `.persist()` materializes anonymously (calibration runs, intermediate materialization not entering KB).

```python
chain.save("dataset_name")  # versioned, in dc.datasets() and KB
chain.save("ns.proj.name", update_version="minor")
chain.persist()  # anonymous, NOT named, NOT in KB
chain.show(limit=10)
chain.to_values("col")  # → flat list
chain.to_list("col1", "col2")  # → list of tuples
chain.to_pandas()
chain.to_parquet("out.parquet")
chain.to_csv("out.csv")
chain.to_pytorch(transform=..., tokenizer=...)
chain.to_storage("s3://output/", signal="file", placement="filepath")
chain.count()
chain.sum("column")
chain.avg("column")
```

**Delta + incremental:**

```python
dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/", update=True, delta=True)
# Defaults: delta_on=("file.path", "file.etag", "file.version"); delta_compare=None.
# Override delta_compare="file.mtime" only when etag is unreliable (e.g. local FS).
# Build scripts reading storage take this path; plain queries over an existing
# listing do not — there, re-listing the bucket only costs time.
```

## Section 6 — Type System

**Structured types — use Pydantic BaseModel:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datachain import model


class Detection(BaseModel):
    label: str
    confidence: float
    bbox: model.BBox
```

**File types (all inherit from `dc.File`):**

| Type | `type=` | `.read()` | Extra methods |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dc.File` | (default) | `bytes` | `.read_text()`, `.open()`, `.ensure_cached()` |
| `dc.TextFile` | `"text"` | `str` | `.read_text()` |
| `dc.ImageFile` | `"image"` | `PIL.Image` | `.get_info()` → `dc.Image` |
| `dc.VideoFile` | `"video"` | — | `.get_frame(frame, ...)`, `.get_frames(step=N, ...)`, `.get_fragments(duration)`, `.get_info()` → `dc.Video` |
| `dc.AudioFile` | `"audio"` | — | `.get_fragments(duration)`, `.get_info()` → `dc.Audio` |

`dc.Image`, `dc.Video`, `dc.Audio` are media metadata models in the `dc` namespace — NOT in `datachain.model`.

Sub-file units: `VideoFrame` (`.timestamp`, `.get_np()`, `.read_bytes(format)`, `.save(path)`), `VideoFragment` (`.save(path)`), `AudioFragment` (`.get_np()` → `(ndarray, sample_rate)`, `.save(path)`).

**Annotation types** (prefer these over custom BaseModels):

```python
from datachain import model      # import is mandatory; dc.model.BBox is not enough

model.BBox(title="car", coords=[x1,y1,x2,y2])              # PASCAL VOC
model.BBox.from_coco([x,y,w,h], title="car")
model.BBox.from_yolo([cx,cy,w,h], img_size=(640,480))
bbox.to_coco() / .to_yolo(img_size) / .to_voc(); bbox.point_inside(x, y)
model.OBBox(...)                                            # oriented bbox (4 corners)
model.Pose(x=[...], y=[...])                                # 2D keypoints
model.Pose3D(x=[...], y=[...], visible=[...])
model.Segment(title="road", x=[...], y=[...])               # segmentation polygon
```

**Column references:**

```python
dc.C("file.size")  # top-level
dc.C("det.bbox.x1")  # nested
dc.C("file.path").glob("*.jpg")
chain.column("price")  # typed column for column-column arithmetic
```

---

## Section 7 — func Module

All run inside Data Memory (no Python, no deserialization). `C` = `dc.C`, `func` = `dc.func`.

```python
# Distance (vector search)
func.cosine_distance(C("emb"), reference)
func.euclidean_distance(...)
func.l2_distance(...)

# Aggregate (in group_by)
func.count()
func.sum(C("file.size"))
func.avg(C("score"))
func.min(C("val"))
func.max(C("val"))
func.collect(C("label"))
func.first(C("path"))

# Path
func.path.file_ext(C("file.path"))  # → "jpg"
func.path.file_stem(C("file.path"))  # → "image01"
func.path.name(C("file.path"))  # → "image01.jpg"
func.path.parent(C("file.path"))  # → "folder/subfolder"

# Conditional
func.case((C("score") > 0.9, "high"), (C("score") > 0.5, "medium"), else_="low")
func.ifelse(func.isnone(C("result")), "pending", "done")

# String
func.string.length(C("text"))
func.string.split(C("path"), "/")

# Window (both partition_by and order_by required)
w = func.window(partition_by="category", order_by="created_at")
chain.mutate(rank=func.rank().over(w), row_num=func.row_number().over(w))

# Ranking (in group_by): func.rank(), func.dense_rank(), func.row_number()

# Hashing / sampling (ClickHouse only — not on local SQLite)
func.sip_hash_64(C("file.path"))
func.int_hash_64(C("file.path"))
```

---

## Section 8 — Common Pipeline Templates

**Basic: read → filter → map → save**

```python
import datachain as dc


def compute_embedding(file: dc.File) -> list[float]:
    return model.encode(file.read()).tolist()


(
    dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/data/")
    .filter(dc.C("file.size") > 1000)
    .settings(parallel=4)
    .map(emb=compute_embedding)
    .save("embeddings")
)
```

**Heavy-init via `.setup()`:**

```python
def encode(file: dc.ImageFile, model, preprocess) -> list[float]:
    img = preprocess(file.read()).unsqueeze(0)
    return model.encode_image(img)[0].tolist()


m, _, p = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms("ViT-B-32", "laion2b_s34b_b79k")

(
    dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/images/", type="image")
    .settings(parallel=4)
    .setup(model=lambda: m, preprocess=lambda: p)
    .map(emb=encode)
    .save("image_embeddings")
)
```

**Multi-stage pipeline (one script per stage; this snippet shows the dataset graph):**

```python
# Stage 1 — build_chunks.py
dc.read_storage("s3://docs/*.pdf").gen(chunk=split_pdf).save("chunks")

# Stage 2 — build_chunk_embeddings.py
(
    dc.read_dataset("chunks")
    .setup(model=lambda: load_embedding_model())
    .settings(parallel=4)
    .map(emb=embed_chunk)
    .save("chunk_embeddings")
)

# Stage 3 — classify_chunks.py
(
    dc.read_dataset("chunk_embeddings")
    .setup(client=lambda: create_llm_client())
    .settings(parallel=8)
    .map(category=classify)
    .save("classified_chunks")
)
```

**Generator (1 input → N outputs):**

```python
from typing import Iterator


class Chunk(BaseModel):
    text: str
    start_offset: int


def split_doc(file: dc.File) -> Iterator[Chunk]:
    for offset, text in chunk(file.read_text()):
        yield Chunk(text=text, start_offset=offset)


(dc.read_storage("s3://docs/").settings(parallel=4).gen(chunk=split_doc).save("chunks"))
```

**Merge sidecar metadata:**

```python
items = dc.read_storage("gs://bucket/data/")
meta = dc.read_json("gs://bucket/annotations.json", jmespath="items")
annotated = items.merge(meta, on="file.path", right_on="items.file_name")
```

**Multi-source merge (shared prefix, inline func, select_except at end):**

```python
annotations = dc.read_storage("gs://b/**/*.txt", type="text").gen(ann=parse_list)
xmls = dc.read_storage("gs://b/**/*.xml").settings(prefetch=128).map(xml=parse_xml)
images = dc.read_storage("gs://b/**/*.jpg", type="image")

(
    images.merge(
        annotations, on=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")), right_on="ann.name"
    )
    .merge(
        xmls,
        on=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")),
        right_on=dc.func.path.file_stem(dc.C("file.path")),
    )
    .select_except("right_file", "ann.name")
    .save("annotated_items")
)
```

**Vector similarity search:**

```python
(
    dc.read_dataset("embeddings")
    .mutate(dist=dc.func.cosine_distance(dc.C("emb"), query_embedding))
    .order_by("dist")
    .limit(10)
    .show()
)
```

**LLM extraction with structured Pydantic output:**

```python
class Analysis(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str
    confidence: float
    topics: list[str]

def analyze(file: dc.File, client) -> Analysis:
    resp = client.messages.create(model="claude-sonnet-4-6", ...)
    return Analysis.model_validate_json(resp.content[0].text)

(dc.read_storage("s3://docs/")
   .setup(client=lambda: anthropic.Anthropic())
   .settings(parallel=8)
   .map(result=analyze)
   .save("analyzed"))
```

**Metadata analytics (no Python needed):**

```python
(
    dc.read_storage("gs://bucket/")
    .filter(dc.C("file.size") > 0)
    .group_by(
        count=dc.func.count(),
        total=dc.func.sum(dc.C("file.size")),
        partition_by=dc.func.path.file_ext(dc.C("file.path")),
    )
    .order_by("total", descending=True)
    .show()
)
```

**Delta updates (incremental):**

```python
(
    dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/data/", update=True, delta=True)
    .map(result=process_file)
    .save("processed_data")
)
```

**In-memory data joined with storage files:**

```python
labels = dc.read_records([{"name": "a.jpg", "cls": "cat"}, ...])
items = dc.read_storage("s3://bucket/data/")
combined = items.merge(labels, on="file.name", right_on="labels.name")
```
